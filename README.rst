Flask-Dance Example App: BitBucket Edition
==========================================

This repository provides an example of how to use `Flask-Dance`_ to connect
to `BitBucket`_ as an OAuth client. The example code is in ``bitbucket.py`` --
all the other files in this repository are secondary. You can run this example
code locally, or deploy it to Heroku for free to see how it runs in a
production-style environment.

Heroku Installation
```````````````````
`Heroku`_ is a great way to get up and running fast, and you don't even need
to open the terminal!

Step 1: Deploy to Heroku
------------------------
It's easy, and it's free! Just click on this button:

|heroku-deploy|

You can leave all the fields at their default values: we'll fill them in later.
The only thing that matters right now is the app name, and Heroku will
autogenerate a name for you if you leave that field blank. Using an
autogenerated name is perfectly fine, just take note of what it is.

Note that your app isn't functional yet, and if you try to visit it right now,
you'll end up at a GitHub 404 page. That's OK, we're not done yet!

Step 2: Get OAuth credentials from GitHub
-----------------------------------------
Visit https://github.com/settings/applications/new to register an
application on GitHub. In order to register the application, you'll need that
app name from Heroku. The GitHub application's authorization callback URL
must be ``https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com/login/github/authorized``. For example,
if Heroku assigned you an app name of ``peaceful-lake``, your authorization
callback URL must be
``https://peaceful-lake.herokuapp.com/login/github/authorized``.

Once you've registered your application on GitHub, GitHub will give you a
client ID and client secret, which we'll use in the next step.

Step 3: Give OAuth credentials to your app on Heroku
----------------------------------------------------
Go to Heroku and visit the settings page for your app. (You can get there from
your Heroku dashboard, or by clicking on the "Manage App" button after the
deploy step is finished.) On that page, there should be a section called
"Config Variables" where you can manage the config vars for your application.
You'll need click the "Reveal Config Vars" button to see which variables
are available, and then the "Edit" button to allow you to change these variables.

Take the client ID you got from GitHub, and paste it into the "VALUE" field
next to the ``GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`` field, replacing the dummy value that
was there before. Similarly, take the client secret you got from GitHub,
and paste it into the "VALUE" field next to the ``GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET``
field, replacing the dummy value that was there before.
Click the "Save" button when you're done.

Step 4: Visit your app and login with GitHub!
---------------------------------------------
Your app name from Heroku will determine the URL that your app is running on:
the URL will be ``https://APPNAME.herokuapp.com``. For example, if Heroku
assigned you an app name of ``peaceful-lake``, your app will be available at
``https://peaceful-lake.herokuapp.com``. Visit that URL, and you should
immediately be redirected to login with GitHub!

**NOTE:** There seems to be a bug with GitHub's OAuth system where the first
time you try to log in, it fails. If this happens to you, simply try it a
second time, and it should succeed.

Local Installation
``````````````````
If you'd prefer to run this locally on your computer, you can do that as well.

Step 1: Get OAuth credentials from GitHub
-----------------------------------------
Visit https://github.com/settings/applications/new to register an
application on GitHub. You must set the application's authorization
callback URL to ``http://localhost:5000/login/github/authorized``.

Once you've registered your application on GitHub, GitHub will give you a
client ID and client secret, which we'll use in step 3.

Step 2: Install code and dependencies
-------------------------------------
Run the following commands on your computer::

    git clone https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance-github.git
    cd flask-dance-github
    pyvenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

These commands will clone this git repository onto your computer,
create a `virtual environment`_ for this project, activate it, and install
the dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt``.

Step 3: Set environment variables
---------------------------------
Many applications use `environment variables`_ for configuration, and
Flask-Dance is no exception. You'll need to set the following environment
variables:

* ``GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID``: set this to the client ID you got from GitHub.
* ``GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET``: set this to the client secret you got from GitHub.
* ``OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT``: set this to ``true``. This indicates that
  you're doing local testing, and it's OK to use HTTP instead of HTTPS for
  OAuth. You should only do this for local testing.
  Do **not** set this in production! [`oauthlib docs`_]

How you set these variables depends on your operating system. For Mac/Linux, you
can use the `export`_ command. For Windows, you can use the `SET`_ command. If
you don't want to worry about this, you can create a ``.env`` file with
your environment variables, and use `foreman`_ to run your app. This repository
has a ``.env.example`` file that you can copy.

Step 4: Run your app and login with GitHub!
-------------------------------------------
If you're setting environment variables manually, run your app using Python::

    python github.py

If you're using a ``.env`` file for your environment variables, install `foreman`_
and use that to run your app::

    foreman start

Then, go to http://localhost:5000/ to visit your app and log in with GitHub!
